# Concordances_CN_PC
 Listings, correspondences and mappings of PC and CN product classifications.

## Overview
This set of programs creates lists of numerical product codes by year (CN8 and PC8), their changes over time from t-1 to t, and mappings from CN to PC. 

See "Correspondences of EU Product Classifications", Duprez and Magerman (2022) for further information.

## Running the correspondences
To obtain the lists and correspondences, copy the folder, set the correct absolute folder path for your system and run notebooks > master.do. This creates all the necessary output. Raw datasets are in "raw", which might need to be unzipped first. Final datasets are available in "clean", in both .dta (Stata 17) and .tsv formats for further use.


## Remarks
If you use any of these listings, correspondences or mappings, please cite "Correspondences of EU Product Classifications", by Cedric Duprez and Glenn Magerman (2022).
